To run the app, first open two terminal shells.
In the first, type make server.
In the second, type make client.
(If these steps don't work, it could be because you haven't compiled Server and/or Client. To do this, type javac Server.java and javac Client.java)

You are now ready to send messages! When the client sends messages to the server it will receive the message (if that message was successfully received by the server) in capitals.
